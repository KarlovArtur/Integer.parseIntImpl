For using this app, you must start run.bat file.

This app allows converter numeric value from String to int.

Terms of usage:
- Length of input string: 2 <=str<=2^32-1;
- String must contains ONLY numerical value, that starts from arithmetical sign (+ or -).
  For example: +12345, -2580;
- You must have installed apache maven for creating package and jvm for run app.
  Thank you.
